			"Matchstick is a mobile app that addresses the challenges faced by matchmakers in their work.\n\n" +
			"Matchmaking is growing all around the world as put by a NYT article, 'With television shows like " +
			"'Million Dollar Matchmaker' and 'Indian Matchmaking,' and a pandemic that has made it harder for singles " +
			"to meet organically, matchmaking is hot again.' For our company, we plan to build an app for matchmakers " +
			"in Pakistan, aka Rishta Aunties, and expand internationally in the future.\n\n" +
			"Based on a survey by BBC, 90% of marriages in the region are arranged marriages, and the majority of " +
			"them are done through matchmakers. Over the years, the matchmaking business in South Asia has evolved " +
			"into a US$292 million industry. Despite this growth, matchmakers continue to rely on outdated pen-and-paper " +
			"methods, leading to challenges and inefficiencies. Our objective is to understand these challenges and " +
			"propose a customer-centric solution that leverages technology to enhance matchmaking efficiency and " +
			"effectiveness in connecting families and enable matchmakers to create meaningful, long-lasting relationships.",
