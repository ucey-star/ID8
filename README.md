# ID8 Project README

This README provides essential information for setting up, running, and understanding the structure of this Next.js project.

## Getting Started

### Installation

After cloning the repository, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you encounter any errors about missing packages, run `npm install` again or install the specific package that's missing.

### Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Build

To create a production build of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate an optimized version of your app for production deployment.

## Project Structure

This project follows the Next.js App Router structure. Here's an overview of the key directories and files:

### Components

- `_components/`: This folder contains reusable React components.
- Component names should be capitalized, e.g., `Header.tsx`.

### Pages and Routing

- `app/page.tsx`: This is the home page of your application.
- To create a new route, follow this structure:
  - Create a new folder in the `app` directory with the route name (e.g., `about`).
  - Inside that folder, create a `page.tsx` file.
  - For example, `app/about/page.tsx` will be accessible at `/about`.

### Layout

- `app/layout.tsx`: This file contains the main layout structure and metadata for your application.

## Additional Information

- The `app` directory is the root of your application in the App Router structure.
- Each `page.tsx` file automatically becomes a route.
- The `layout.tsx` file can be used to create shared layouts for multiple pages.
